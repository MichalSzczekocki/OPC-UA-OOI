# OPC UA DataBinding library

## Introduction

This project is aimed at implementing an editor of the `OOI Reactive Application` configuration file. For more extensive examples, see the [Semantic-Data Message Centric Communication](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/internet-of-things-iot-archetype/readme.messagecentriccommunication).

The schema of the configuration files is available at:  [ConfigurationData.xsd](../../Configuration/Networking/Serialization/ConfigurationData.xsd) and detailed description of the configuration is captured in the document [UA Data Networking Configuration](../../Configuration/Networking/README.MD#ua-data-networking-configuration).

The code help documentation is [available for sponsors - consider joining](https://github.commsvr.com/AboutPartnershipProgram.md.html)

The NuGet package is available here: [OPC UA DataBindings Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UAOOI.Configuration.DataBindings).

To install OPC UA DataBindings Library, run the following command in the  Package Manager Console

> `PM>  Install-Package UAOOI.DataBindings`

## Getting Started Tutorial

The topics contained in this section are intended to give you quick exposure to the `OOI Reactive Application` network based data exchange programming experience. Working through this tutorial gives you an introductory understanding of the steps required to create `OOI Reactive Application` configuration custom editor. The editor is to be used by an universal tool supporting OPC UA Information Model design process. For more information on deploying OPC UA Information Model read the document: [Information Models Development](../../SemanticData/InformationModelsDevelopment.md)

The configuration files are managed using the `UAOOI.Configuration.Networking` component.
